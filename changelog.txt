  - Lower performance impact by roughly 100x by scanning more lazily.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2

  - Blacklist recipes from promethium-quality for compatiblity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
  Changes:
  - New inventory transfer logic.
  - Fixes modules being transfered to recyler inputs when quality modules get inserted.
  - Fixes modules jumping slots when quality modules get inserted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
  Known Issues:
  - Version 2.0.28 of Factorio doesn't allow for undo patching anymore. This does not seem to be fixable. The undo history patching has been disabled if the game version is above 2.0.20.
  Balance:
  - Default Cost Increase lowered from +350% to +225%.
  - Default Time Increase lowered from +50% to 0%.
  - Recyling recipes are hardcoded to not consider 25% of the ingredients as cost, making upcycling slightly cheaper.
  - Productivity research now also affect upcrafted recipes.
    - The productivity cap of recipes scales with the cost increase, so there is a use for researching productivity increases more than 30 times now.
  Features:
  - New Machine: The Fabricator is an Assembling Machine with a built-in +50% Quality modifier (same cost increase as a quality module), but it can only craft Intermediate Products (including Metallurgy and Chemistry).
    - The Fabricator also has a built-in 20% Productivity modifier to stay relevant even after setting up Quality Module 3 production.
  - New Technology that unlocks the Fabricator and Uncommon quality, allowing some early quality crafting even before Plastic production.
  - Improved logic for self-referential recipes. Cost increase now calculates the actual "cost" of the recipe, ignoring items that you get back once the recipe is finished.
    - For example Ore Washing takes 5 ore as ingredient, but creates 2-3 ore as output, meaning the ore cost is now calculated as 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.
    - Upcrafting Pentapod Eggs and Bacteria now only requires additional nutrients/bioflux/water, as they take less inputs than outputs.
    - And of course the same logic applies to all the asteroid processing and all self-referential recipes from mods as well.
  - More robust handling of item requests when inserting quality modules. This needs version 2.0.11 of Factorio, as that's when the API for this was introduced.
  Misc:
  - Change text capitalization to be consistent with base game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
  Changes:
  - Fix errors from entities that aren't placable by anything. (Mod compatiblity.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
  Changes:
  - Fix typo in copying placeable_by.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Features:
  - The total cost increase and time increase is now displayed on the crafting machine.
  - Implement Setting Copy & Paste for machines with differing amounts of Quality modules.
  - Explicitly hide upcrafting recipes from Signal UI.
  Changes:
  - More robust code to detect the correct placeable_by property. (Better mod compatiblity.)
  - More robust entity replacement:
    - Fix some crafting machines not keeping their rotation when inserting/removing quality modules.
    - Fix losing modules when selecting recipe that is incompatible with said module.
    - Flush fluids when adding/removing quality modules so that they don't get lost.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Changes:
  - Experimental fix for mod incompabtiblity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Changes:
  - Fix recyling recipes not being unlocked.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
  Changes:
  - Hide upcrafting recipe unlocks on technology UI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Features:
  - Detect recipes that require more than 65k of an ingredient and disables them. Gives a nice warning message in the description too.
  - Now supports recipes without ingredients. In this case time/energy will be increased instead by modules.
  - Quality recipes should only be enabled after researching the appropriate tech. This was a minor oversight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Changes:
  - Fixed mod ignoring higher quality quality modules.
  - No longer create variants for crafting machines that don't accept quality modules. (Better mod compatiblity.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
  Changes:
  - Initial release.
