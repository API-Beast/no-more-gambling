Version: 1.0.2
  Changes:
    - Detect recipes that require more than 65k of an ingredient and disables them. Gives a nice warning message in the description too.
    - Now supports recipes without ingredients. In this case time/energy will be increased instead by modules.
	- Quality recipes should only be enabled after researching the appropriate tech. This was a minor oversight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Changes:
    - Fixed mod ignoring higher quality quality modules.
    - No longer create variants for crafting machines that don't accept quality modules. (Better mod compatiblity.)
